    <h1 class = "title-text">WHAT IS THE KETO DIET?</h1>
    <p class = "article-text"> If you research different ways to lose weight, you’ll come across various diets and lifestyle tweaks to turn your body into a fat-burning machine.
        Increasing the intensity and frequency of your exercise routine is one way to lose body fat and trim your trouble spots, but it’s not the only way. You can also burn more fat through a metabolic state called ketosis, which is the mechanism behind many low-carb diets, including the ketogenic diet and the Atkins diet. Understanding what ketosis is and learning how to achieve this state can help you whip your body into shape.
        The diet calls for consuming high amounts of fat, a moderate amount of protein, and a very limited amount of carbs. It’s usually broken down to 75, 20, and 5 percent of your daily calories.
        After you follow the diet for a few days, your body enters ketosis, which means it has started to use fat for energy. Newbies on the diet find it helpful to track whether they’re in ketosis with a urine ketone strip or a blood-prick meter, but you’ll eventually learn what ketosis feels like and will know whether you’re in it.

    <div class="k-c-item2">
        <h2 class="k-c-t">How It Works</h2>
         <p class="k-c-p">When you eat less than 50 grams of carbs a day, your body eventually runs out of fuel (blood sugar) it can use quickly. This typically takes 3 to 4 days. Then you’ll start to break down protein and fat for energy, which can make you lose weight. This is called ketosis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="k-c-item3">
         <h2 class="k-c-t">How Do You Achieve Ketosis Successfully?</h2>
         <p class="k-c-p">Putting — and then keeping — your body in ketosis isn’t exactly easy. You’ll need to severely minimize your intake of carbohydrates, eating no more than 20 to 50 grams (g) of carbs per day to get there and stay there. A single medium pear, for example, contains 26 g of carbs, and even foods that aren’t generally considered high in carbs — such as nuts and non starchy veggies — contain a small amount of carbohydrates, and so will need to be limited or avoided on this plan.
        If you’re following the keto diet, you will need protein, but you should limit your intake to about 20 percent of your total daily calories. This is important because when you consume more protein than you need, your body converts the excess protein into carbs through a process called gluconeogenesis. This process pushes your body out of ketosis.
        Intermittent fasting is another way to achieve ketosis. This doesn’t suggest going days without food, but rather intermittent fasting. You can eat for eight hours and then fast for 16 hours, or eat a low-calorie diet for a few days (about 1,200 daily calories if you’re a woman and 1,500 daily calories if you’re a man). As you take in less food, your body uses more of its fat stores for fuel.</p>

        <h2 class="k-c-t">(STARTER-KIT)</h2>
        <p class="k-c-p">A ketogenic diet is specific; the entire point is to eat foods that get you into ketosis and keep you there. But it’s not just eating keto-friendly foods that influences your ketone levels. The amount of food you eat and your specific reactions to foods and activities can affect your ketone levels and blood-glucose levels, which in turn can affect your success with ketosis. This means you can be doing everything “right” and still struggle to reach the levels of ketosis you desire. The only way to find out is to test your ketone levels. Monitoring your ketones gives you insight into how your body is responding. It also gives you clues and opportunity to adjust your diet a little more. Perhaps you want to tweak you carbs or you want to identify trigger foods. Testing allows you to see how minor adjustments affect your results and allows you the capability to discover which foods have the most impact on your ketone levels, good and bad. Or perhaps you want to see how your ketone levels respond to various stimuli, such as exercising or eating a specific type of keto-friendly sugar. Again, the only way to find out is to test.</p>
