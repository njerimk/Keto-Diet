    <h3 class="subtitles">Low-Carb Vegetables</h3>
    Choose vegetables that are non-starchy and low in carbohydrates to integrate into your keto diet. There are many of them that are high in nutritional value, specifically vitamin C and other minerals. When choosing what vegetables to eat, always look at the digestible carb count to ensure that they are not absorbed by the body. A few good examples of starchy vegetables are potatoes, beets, and yams. Consuming these types of vegetables will provide you with all the carbohydrates you need for the day. If you want to limit carb intake, opt for cruciferous vegetables instead like broccoli, cauliflower, or kale. They are good substitutes for the high-carb vegetables mentioned above. In addition, they are known to offer many health benefits including decreasing your risk for heart diseases and cancer.

    <h3>Meat and Poultry</h3>

    Consuming meat and poultry is a good component of a keto diet. In fact, these two are considered as staples in this type of diet. Meat and poultry do not have carbohydrates. And yet, they are packed with B vitamins and minerals such as zinc, potassium, and selenium. They are also a good source of protein that is known to preserve your muscle mass if you switch to a low-carb diet.A study has shown that consuming diets rich in fatty meat has led to higher levels of good cholesterol (versus low-fat, high-carb diet). When choosing meat to add into this kind of diet, be sure to choose grass-fed ones, though. This will give you a higher amount of omega-3 fatty acid and antioxidants.

  <div class="eggs">

    <h3>Eggs</h3>

    Eggs are another staple in the keto diet. It is also one of the healthiest and most versatile types of food around. A single piece of egg contains a gram of carbs and less than 6 grams of protein. Hence, it is the quintessential keto food item.There are also many other benefits to eggs that make it a healthy addition to your low-carb diet. It is known to trigger hormones that make you feel fuller so you are more likely to eat less. It can also aid in lowering your calorie intake for up to 24 hours. In addition, the yolk of an egg is filled with nutrients such as antioxidants that benefit your eye and heart health. But be very careful when consuming too many eggs as it is linked to high cholesterol.

    <h3>Seafood</h3>

    If you want to vary your protein source in a keto diet, seafood is a good option. Fish and other types of shellfish are keto-friendly, so this is good news for seafood lovers. Salmon, for example, is high in selenium, potassium, and B vitamins while being relatively carb-free. The amount of carbohydrates does vary from one type of shellfish to another – make sure you take time to learn about the carb content for each to make your decision.To give you an idea, the following types of shellfish are a safe bet for a keto-friendly diet: clams, mussels, oysters, octopus, and squid. Aside from salmon, mackerel and sardines are other good alternatives that are also high in omega-3 fatty acids. They are recommended for obese or overweight people who are trying to shed off excess weight. Ideally, you need to get at least two servings of seafood per week.

  <div class="nuts">

    <h3>Nuts and Seeds</h3>

    Adding nuts and seeds to your diet will not only enrich the benefits of your keto diet, but also give you plenty of nutrients. Various types of nuts and seeds are low in carbs and high in fat (the good kind). Consuming nuts on a regular basis is known to fight certain types of cancers, depression, and chronic diseases. It is also linked to lowered risk for heart diseases. Nuts and seeds are also good sources of fiber. This means that you feel fuller and absorb fewer calories. The best types of nuts and seeds to incorporate into your keto diet are as follows: almonds, walnuts, pistachios, macadamia nuts, pecan, cashews, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, chia seeds, and flaxseed.

    <h3>Berries</h3>

    The health benefits of berries when incorporated to your diet are widely known. In general, fruits are good components to add to your keto diet, but you can amplify those benefits when you choose to consume berries regularly.Berries are high in fiber and low in carbs, which makes it ideal for a keto diet. Some examples of berries to add to your diet include blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. Aside from being high in fiber, these fruits are packed with antioxidants. This enables you to be protected from certain diseases and to reduce inflammation.

  <div class="olives">

    <h3>Olives (and Olive Oil)</h3>

    Consuming olives or cooking with olive oil can bring about the same benefits you would expect from a ketogenic diet. A specific type of antioxidant known as oleuropein is a good source of anti-inflammatory properties that can protect cells from damage. There are also plenty of studies that show how olives can prevent bone loss and lower blood pressure. The carb content in olives vary greatly depending on the size. But since they are also rich in fiber, the carbs are easily digestible. Olive oil brings about as many health benefits as olive does. It is rich in oleic acid, which is a type of monosaturated fat that is known to lower risk for heart diseases. You can also go for extra virgin olive oil, which contains phenols (an antioxidant) that protect your heart health.

    <h3>Dark Chocolate</h3>

    Indulging in chocolate, especially dark ones, is acceptable in a keto diet. Cocoa, the main source of chocolate, is referred to as a “super fruit” because it is packed with antioxidants. Dark chocolate is a good source of flavanols that can reduce blood pressure, maintain healthy arteries, and lower your risk for heart disease. When including dark chocolate (and cocoa powder) in your diet, make sure they are 70% cocoa solids (or higher).<br><br>
