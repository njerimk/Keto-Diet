    <p class="article-text">
      <h2 class="subtitle-text">The ketogenic (keto) diet gets credit for being a fast way to lose weight, but research suggests <br>many other benefits are possible with this low-carb, high-fat approach to eating.<br>In addition to weight loss, a low-carb or keto diet can potentially improve your health <br>and quality of life in many ways.</h2><br>

  <div class="benefits">
    <ol class="effects-list">
      <li><b>Blood sugar and insulin (Reverse/reduce risk of diabetes T2)</b></li><br>
      <p>Whenever you eat a low carbohydrate and high-fat diet your blood sugar levels reduce dramatically as does the insulin you produce to deal with it.<br>Since insulin release goes hand in hand with eating carbs, diabetes can be drastically improved by switching to a strict low-carb diet (keto).</p><br>
      <li><b>Normalize blood pressure</b></li><br>
      <p>Insulin is the main fat-storing hormone in the body, and too much insulin can therefore lead to becoming overweight in the long run. Whatâ€™s more, elevated insulin levels can lead to the accumulation of fluid and salt in the body which increases blood pressure.
        In addition, high levels of insulin can thicken the tissue around blood vessels (the so-called smooth muscle), which also may contribute to an elevated blood pressure.
        Therefore, it makes sense that interventions aimed at reducing insulin levels will greatly improve hypertension and metabolic syndrome.</p><br>
      <li><b>Reverse PCOS</b></li><br>
      <p>It is well known that lifestyle changes resulting in weight loss can improve PCOS symptoms, and so can the type 2 diabetes drug metformin. Given the strong connection to excess weight, high insulin levels and other metabolic problems, a low-carb diet is potentially ideal for reversing PCOS.</p><br>
      <li><b>Heart  health</b></li><br>
      <p>Ketogenic diets increase levels of HDL (Good cholesterol) and also lower Triglyceride levels in the blood which are major risk factors in heart disease.</p><br>
      <li><b>Appetite</b></li><br>
      <p>A properly implemented Ketogenic Diet has the added benefit of curbing hunger pangs through its unique action in suppressing the hunger hormone Ghrelin. Hunger is by far the biggest obstacle in most weight reduction diet plans.</p><br>
      <li><b>Greater weight loss</b></li><br>
      <p>Not only do you experience the dramatic weight loss in the first few weeks of a Ketogenic Diet, but you will also see a constant steady loss of fat thereafter due to the appetite suppressing and muscle sparing factors of a Ketogenic Diet.</p><br>
      <li><b>Neurological benefits</b></li><br>
      <p>The Ketogenic Diet has been used for a century in treating Epilepsy, more than 50% of people treated see a reduction in seizures and over 14% become completely seizure free. It is also being studied as a treatment for Alzheimers, Parkinson Disease, Bi-Polar and more.</p><br>
      <li><b>Mood stabilizing</b></li><br>
      <p>It is no secret that if you feed a child sugary treats and beverages that you can expect a degree of hyper behaviour and mood swings followed by a sudden crash. This is no different with adults. Though by the time a person has aged somewhat the physical aspect of this spike has turned purely mental. No such thing on a Keto Diet.</p><br>
      <li><b>Longer lasting energy</b></li><br>
      <p>Fat has the benefit of giving our bodies a longer lasting and sustained energy than that of carbohydrates. This is probably why many elite athletes in sporting fields of duration have turned to a higher fat lower carb way of eating to fuel their bodies.</p><br>
